### Conceptual Foundations
The program laid the groundwork for understanding the broader landscape of cybersecurity, including:

- **Risk Management**: Identifying and mitigating potential threats to an organization's assets.
- **Threat Analysis**: Understanding various types of cyber threats and how to assess them.
- **Network Security**: Defending systems against attacks and ensuring safe communication across networks.
- **Incident Response**: Developing and applying structured procedures to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.

### Technical Skills
In addition to theoretical knowledge, I gained practical skills using industry-standard tools and platforms:

- **Linux**: Navigating and managing systems via the command line.
- **Python**: Automating security tasks and analyzing data.
- **SQL**: Querying databases to investigate incidents and uncover anomalies.
- **SIEM Tools**: Working with tools like **Splunk** and **Google Chronicle** to monitor and analyze security logs.
- **Network Protocol Analyzers**: Using **Wireshark** and **tcpdump** to inspect and troubleshoot network traffic.
- **IDS/IPS Systems**: Understanding how to deploy and interpret results from intrusion detection/prevention systems.
- **Firewalls**: Configuring and managing firewall rules to safeguard networks.
